To build image out of docker file we are running below command

Along with command we have to give two parameters for building docker image

1) we have to give image name along with tag

2) allocation of docker file..we need to tell docker from which dockerfile we need to build image

COMMAND:

docker build -t myapp:1.0 .

docker build -t [IMAGE_NAME]:[VERSION_TAG] [DOCKERFILE ALLOCATION]
